Using `README_Template_Frontend.md` rewrite `README.md`. Pay close attention to any prompts marked with !!!

When using the prompts found in the template, check for any relevant files it mentions found in the folder base folder of the service-name

If you can't find any information for a section/topic note it as such wrapping the text in *** ***

You should NOT create any new sections that aren't listed under the template

Once you have completed it, output the text in one cohesive .md output labelled as `README_NEW.md`
